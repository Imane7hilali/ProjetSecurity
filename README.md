# IOT for health monitoring
This project involves the design and implementation of a web application that allows real-time analysis and generation of graphs from data collected from a connected wristband. In addition to real-time graph generation, the web application also offers features such as data analysis, visualization of parameter averages over different time periods (5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, etc.), and the generation of alerts in case of abnormal values that could pose a health risk to the user. The technical architecture of the project is based on the use of Apache Kafka to simulate the connection between the wristband and the server. To generate real-time data, we developed a script using the Faker library, which allows us to simulate data creation realistically. MongoDB is used for data storage, FastAPI for creating the backend API, and React for displaying the data on the frontend. In a second scenario, some modifications were made to the existing architecture. Instead of using Apache Kafka and the Faker library-based Producer script, a mobile application was integrated to generate data and send it directly to the backend.
